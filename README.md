CoffeeBreak
===========

CoffeeBreak is a Chrome Extension I created out of frustration with always having to think in CoffeeScript and JavaScript when looking up ember.js examples. It allows converting CoffeeScript files on GitHub to JavaScript leveraging [oauth2-extensions](https://github.com/borismus/oauth2-extensions) and the GitHub API to create gists of the converted content.

TODO
====

1. Convert JavaScript => CoffeeScript
2. Allow converting of CoffeeScript/JS on other sites (StackOverflow, other Gists, ect.)
3. Find a way to include comments into the converted content
4. Include option to auto delete gists which were created by CoffeeBreak after X amount of time
